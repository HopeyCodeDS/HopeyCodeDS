## 🚀 About Me

I’m an **AI & Software Engineer** passionate about transforming ideas into intelligent, data-driven solutions.

My work sits at the intersection of **AI research and software engineering**, where I design and deploy production-ready systems powered by machine learning, cloud technologies, and modern backend architecture.

I enjoy:
- Architecting scalable AI platforms
- Designing data pipelines and vector retrieval systems
- Building multi-agent workflows
- Deploying real-time AI applications in the cloud

I’m continuously learning, building, and experimenting — from fine-tuning LLMs to architecting full-stack AI systems that make real impact.

## Featured AI Projects

### VentureSignal — AI-Powered B2B SaaS Startup Screener
AI deal-sourcing pipeline that ingests YC startup data, enriches companies via web scraping, and scores them against a VC investment thesis using LLMs.

**Key Highlights:**
- Automated end-to-end VC analyst workflow: ingest → enrich → score → dashboard
- LLM scoring engine (Claude API) with structured JSON output validated by Pydantic
- Async Python backend (FastAPI + httpx) with rate-limited external calls
- React + TypeScript dashboard with filtering, sorting, and score breakdowns
- Dockerized multi-service architecture with CI/CD via GitHub Actions
